# Forest Topology

Protecting biodiversity and curbing carbon emissions from deforestation demands
a deeper understanding of global forest cover. Informed decision-making hinges
not only on knowing where forests are, but on understanding their composition
and distinguishing natural forests that play critical roles as biodiversity
hotspots and major carbon sinks.

[Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/) (GDM) and
[Google Research](https://research.google/) in collaboration with partners
([World Resources Institute](https://www.wri.org/) (WRI),
[Google Geo Sustainability](https://earthoutreachonair.withgoogle.com/)) are
developing AI models to estimate the forest types and to generate regional to
global maps of forest land cover. In addition to releasing these layers we
create benchmark datasets for AI researchers.

## Forest layers

*   TBD.

## Benchmark datasets

*   [ForTy (v1)](./forty_v1/README.md) - a forest types benchmark dataset.
