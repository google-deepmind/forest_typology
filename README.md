# Forest Typology

Protecting biodiversity and curbing carbon emissions from deforestation demands
a deeper understanding of global forest cover. Informed decision-making hinges
not only on knowing where forests are, but on understanding their composition
and distinguishing forest types that play critical roles as biodiversity
hotspots and major carbon sinks.

[Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/) (GDM) in collaboration with external
([World Resources Institute](https://www.wri.org/) (WRI)), and internal partners
([Google Research](https://research.google/),
[Google Geo Sustainability](https://earthoutreachonair.withgoogle.com/)) are
developing AI models to estimate the forest types and to generate regional to
global maps of forest land cover. In addition to releasing these layers we
create benchmark datasets for AI researchers.

## Forest and habitat layers

*   Natural forests of the world (Upcoming).
*   Global drivers of forest loss (Upcoming).

## Benchmark datasets

*   [ForTy (v1)](./forty_v1/README.md) - global multi-temporal multi-source
    segmentation benchmark dataset for forest types.
*   [Planted](./planted/README.md) - large-scale benchmark dataset for planted
    forest recognition (with subtasks for monoculture plantation tree species
    and genera recognition).
